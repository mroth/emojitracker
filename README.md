Emojitracker is a complex project with a service-oriented architecture, and thus
has now been split up into multiple repositories.  This repository mainly just
serves as table of contents of sorts. Major components of the project are listed
below.

> **Note**
> Since 2021, Emojitracker was [acquired by Emojipedia](https://blog.emojipedia.org/emojipedia-emojitracker/), and is now maintained by them. You can find all of the repositories in the [Emojitracker GitHub organization](https://github.com/emojitracker).

## Architecture
